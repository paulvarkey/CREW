CREW-WILDFIRE is an open-source benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based multi-agent Agentic AI systems in complex, dynamic, real-world tasks. Built on the human-AI teaming CREW simulation platform, it provides procedurally generated wildfire response scenarios that test the limits of multi-agent coordination, communication, and planning under uncertainty.

## Overview

CREW-WILDFIRE addresses the gap in existing multi-agent benchmarks by offering:

- Large-scale environments supporting 2000+ agents
- Heterogeneous agent types (drones, helicopters, bulldozers, firefighters)
- Partial observability and stochastic dynamics
- Long-horizon planning objectives
- Both low-level control and high-level natural language interactions


Through these features, researchers can evaluate and develop next-generation multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks in high scale and complex scenarios, bridging the gap between conceptual toy enviornments and real world problems.

## Implemented Algorithms

CREW-WILDFIRE includes implementations of four state-of-the-art LLM-based multi-agent frameworks:

* **CAMON**: A hybrid coordination system featuring dynamic leadership where task assignments and global updates are managed by a changing leader agent. Leadership, along with global data is passed through each agnet by agent-to-agent interactions.

* **COELA**: A decentralized structure where each agent independently proposes information, evaluates the necessity of communication, and performs actions based on its generated plans.

* **Embodied**: A decentralized system without leader agents, featuring alternating communication rounds that allow both broadcast and targeted message exchanges, followed by independent action planning.

* **HMAS-2**: A hybrid framework combining centralized planning with distributed agent feedback. The system proposes actions through a central planner and refines them through agent consensus.

These implementations showcase different approaches to multi-agent coordination, from fully decentralized to hybrid architectures, enabling comprehensive evaluation of various coordination strategies.

## Key Features

* **Procedural Environment Generation**: Dynamic creation of environments using Perlin noise textures for vegetation, elevation, moisture, settlement, and wind vector maps
* **Heterogeneous Agent Support**: Multiple agent types with diverse capabilities
* **Scalable Architecture**: Support for large-scale agent deployment (2000+ agents)
* **Flexible Interaction Modes**: Both low-level control primitives and natural language commands
* **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Built-in metrics for assessing coordination, spatial reasoning, and plan adaptation
* **LLM Integration**: Native support for implementing and testing LLM-based multi-agent frameworks
* **Real-world Complexity**: Partial observability, stochastic dynamics, and complex objectives
