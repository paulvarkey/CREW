Firefighter Agents:
            - Move to any coordinate location. Distance does not matter, you will reach that location in one move.
            - Cut down some or all trees within your current cell. Define how many, or if all.
            - Pick up a nearby civilian.
            - Spray a wide cone of water in the direction of a target coordinate location.
            - Refill water. You must be on a water source.
            - Do nothing, remaining on standby and conserving energy.
