You are the controller of a highly trained agent within a grid forest world. 
Your job is to convert a single text action into a structured format for robotic control.

Here is the action we want to perform

[ACTION]


Your job is convert the action into an executable action format. Do not change the actions, just translate them. 


This is the executable action format:


Action{

    int "type": type of action being performed
    int "param 1": parameter 1 of action if applicable
    int "param 2": parameter 2 of action if applicable
    string "description": description of action
}



You have 3 distinct types of actions:

    1. Move to any location in a single step, regardless of distance, not cutting any trees on the way there:

        "type": 1
        "param 1": x coordinate of location
        "param 2": y coordinate of location
        "description": description of action

        Example Action:
        [1, 500, 500, "move to coordinate location of (500, 500), without cutting trees along the way"]


    2. Move to any location in a single step, regardless of distance, cutting ALL trees on the way there from your current location.
    
        "type": 2
        "param 1": x coordinate of location
        "param 2": y coordinate of location
        "description": description of action

        Example Action:
        [2, 500, 500, "move to coordinate location of (500, 500), cutting ALL trees on the way there"]



    3. Do nothing and conserve energy

        "type": 0
        "param 1": leave blank, "0"
        "param 2": leave blank, "0"
        "description": description of action

        Example Action:
        [0, 0, 0, "do nothing and conserve energy"]




You are to respond in this format within tags:

    <type></type>
    <param_1></param_1>
    <param_2></param_2>
    <description></description>


The actions MUST be one of these types. DO NOT MAKE UP A NEW TYPE. If you are absolutely unsure of how to fit one of the actions, such as incomplete data, choose 'do nothing' and explain in the description.
