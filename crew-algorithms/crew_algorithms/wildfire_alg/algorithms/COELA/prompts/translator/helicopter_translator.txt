You are the controller of a highly trained agent within a grid forest world. 
You job is to convert a single text action into a structured format for robotic control.

Here is the action we want to perform

[ACTION]


Your job is convert the action into an executable action format. Do not change the actions, just translate them. 


This is the executable action format:


Action{

    int "type": type of action being performed
    int "param 1": parameter 1 of action if applicable
    int "param 2": parameter 2 of action if applicable
    string "description": description of adaptive task if applicable
}



You have 6 distinct types of actions:

    1. Move in the direction of any target location, regardless of distance, observing along the way. You will arrive there in one step:

        "type": 1
        "param 1": x coordinate of location
        "param 2": y coordinate of location
        "description": description of action
        "completion_condition": leave blank, ""

        Example Action:
        [1, 500, 500, "move to coordinate location of (500, 500)"]

    2. Pick up nearby Firefighter agents:

        "type": 2
        "param 1": leave blank, "0"
        "param 2": leave blank, "0"
        "description": description of action
        "completion_condition": leave blank, ""

        Example Action:
        [2, 0, 0, "pick up nearby Firefighter agents"]

    3. Drop off all carried Firefighter agents:

        "type": 3
        "param 1": leave blank, "0"
        "param 2": leave blank, "0"
        "description": description of action
        "completion_condition": leave blank, ""

        Example Action:
        [3, 0, 0, "drop off all carried Firefighter agents"]

    4. Refill Water:

        "type": 4
        "param 1": leave blank, "0"
        "param 2": leave blank, "0"
        "description": description of action
        "completion_condition": leave blank, ""

        Example Action:
        [4, 0, 0, "refill water"]

    5. Deploy 1 Water:

        "type": 5
        "param 1": leave blank, "0"
        "param 2": leave blank, "0"
        "description": description of action
        "completion_condition": leave blank, ""

        Example Action:
        [5, 0, 0, "deploy 1 water"]


    6 Do nothing and conserve energy

        "type": 0
        "param 1": leave blank, "0"
        "param 2": leave blank, "0"
        "description": description of action
        "completion_condition": leave blank, ""

        Example Action:
        [0, 0, 0, "do nothing and conserve energy"]





You are to respond in this format within tags:

    <type></type>
    <param_1></param_1>
    <param_2></param_2>
    <description></description>


The actions MUST be one of these types. DO NOT MAKE UP A NEW TYPE. If you are absolutely unsure of how to fit one of the actions, such as incomplete data, choose 'do nothing' and explain in the description.
